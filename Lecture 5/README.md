## Coding Assignment:

- `Clean up` your code.
- Create a `Folder Structure` for your app.
- Make `different files` for each Component.
- Create a `config file`.
- Use all types of `import and export`.
- Create a `Restaurant Filter button`
- Use `useState` to create a variable and `bind` it to the `Restaurant Filter Button`.
- Try to make your `Filter Button Work`.


# Two types of Export/Import 

- Default  Export/Import

export default Component;
import Component from "path";


- Named  Export/Import

export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";


# React Hooks

    (Normal JS utility functions)
- useState()    - Super powerful state variables in react   80% of the time we'll be using this
- useEffect()   20% of the time we'll be using this


# Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)

- suppose i have 7 restro cards and after filtering it gets converted to 3 restro cards.
- virtual DOM is repressentation of an actual DOM
- it finds out the diff btw two virtual DOMs and update the UI very quickly
